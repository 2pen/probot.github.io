# probot.github.io

This is the home of probot.github.io, a website for [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) documentation, apps, how-to guides and more. 

## Documentation

The majority of documentation on the site is drawn from [the probot docs](https://github.com/probot/probot/blob/master/docs/). If you have requests for documentation additions to probot, please open an issue in [probot/probot](https://github.com/probot/probot), or if you want to add them yourself, feel free to open a pull request there.

If you would like to have your plugin listed there, check out our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/probot/probot.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about what the requirements are to do that.
